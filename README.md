# Caesar Cipher (Python)

A simple command-line Caesar Cipher program written in Python.  
This project allows users to **encode** or **decode** messages by shifting letters through the alphabet.

## 🔐 How It Works

The Caesar Cipher is a classic encryption technique where each letter in a message is shifted forward or backward in the alphabet by a fixed number.

- **Encode**: shifts letters forward
- **Decode**: shifts letters backward
- Non-letter characters (spaces, punctuation, numbers) remain unchanged
- Alphabet wrapping is handled automatically (e.g., `z → a`)
